Abiquo API Command Line Tool
============================

This project is a simple command line tool for the Abiquo Cloud Platform API, using
Jython as a wrapper to the [jclouds](https://github.com/jclouds/jclouds) Abiquo provider.
To understand the code and adapt it to your needs, you may want to take a
look at:

 * [Abiquo provider Source code](https://github.com/jclouds/jclouds/tree/master/labs/abiquo)
 * [jclouds Documentation](http://www.jclouds.org)


Requirements
------------

To run Kahuna you will need to install *Maven >= 2.2.1* and *JRE >= 1.6*.
***Jython >= 2.5.2*** is also required, but the setup script will install
it for you.


Installation
------------

You can install Kahuna with the setup script:

    git clone git://github.com/nacx/kahuna.git
    cd kahuna
    chmod u+x setup.sh
    sudo ./setup.sh

By default the setup script will install *Jython 2.5.3* and *virtualenv* in your system.
If you already have a Jython runtime and want to install Kahuna in it, you can instead execute
the setup script as follows (*virtualenv* is required, so make sure it is already installed
if you are using this option):

    sudo ./setup.sh -j /your/jython/install/directory

To see a complete list of installation options you can run:

    ./setup.sh -h

Running
-------

You can run now the command line as follows. If you run it without parameters, it will
print the help with all the available options:

    $ kahuna
    
    Usage: kahuna <plugin> <command> [<options>]
    The following plugins are available:
    
    Interactive shell plugin. 
        shell open     Opens an interactive shell.
    
    Template plugin. 
        template find	 Find a template given its name. 
        template list	 List all available templates.

        vm create       Creates a virtual machine based on a given template. 
        vm delete       Delete a virtual machine given its name. 
        vm deploy       Deploy an existing virtual machine given its name. 
        vm find         Find a virtual machine given its name. 
        vm list         List all virtual machines. 
        vm undeploy     Undeploy an existing virtual machine given its name. 


Use it interactively
--------------------

You can also perform actions against the Api in an interactive way. You just need to
use the 'shell' plugin as follows:

    $ kahuna shell open
    Jython 2.5.2 (Release_2_5_2:7206, Mar 2 2011, 23:12:06) 
    [Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (Sun Microsystems Inc.)] on java1.6.0_18
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> from kahuna.session import ContextLoader
    >>> ctx = ContextLoader().load()
    Using endpoint: http://10.60.1.222/api
    >>> cloud = ctx.getCloudService()         
    >>> cloud.listVirtualDatacenters()
    [VirtualDatacenter [id=11, type=XENSERVER, name=Kaahumanu]]
    >>> vdc = cloud.listVirtualDatacenters()[0]
    >>> vdc.setName("Updated VDC")
    >>> vdc.update()
    >>> cloud.listVirtualDatacenters()         
    [VirtualDatacenter [id=11, type=XENSERVER, name=Updated VDC]]
    >>> ctx.close()
    >>> exit()


Adding more plugins

Plugins are easy to create. Take a look at the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/nacx/kahuna/wiki)
to see how to create and add your own plugins.
